    <p class="mt-3">Whey protein isolate (WPI) is a highly processed form of whey protein. It is obtained from the liquid leftover during cheese production and undergoes further processing to eliminate fat and lactose, creating a product rich in protein, usually containing over 90% protein content. This extensive processing results in a pure and concentrated form of protein that is easily digestible and ideal for individuals seeking a high-quality protein supplement. Due to its ultrafiltration process, whey protein isolate is known for its rapid absorption rate in the body, making it a popular choice among athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and individuals looking to support muscle recovery and growth. Its high protein concentration also makes it an efficient option for meeting daily protein needs while minimizing carbohydrate and fat intake.</p>
