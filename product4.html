    <p class="mt-3">Glutamine, a naturally occurring amino acid categorized as non-essential due to the body's capability of producing it on its own, is abundant in various food sources and serves as a fundamental component for protein synthesis. Moreover, this amino acid plays an indispensable role in supporting immune system functionality by aiding in the production of white blood cells, which are essential for protecting the body from infections. Additionally, glutamine is crucial for the optimal functioning of the digestive system, as it helps maintain the integrity of the intestinal lining and supports the absorption of nutrients. Therefore, ensuring an adequate intake of glutamine through dietary sources or supplementation is vital for supporting overall health and well-being.</p>
